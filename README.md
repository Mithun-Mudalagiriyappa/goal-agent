# 🎯 Goal-Oriented Task Agent
* A locally hosted agentic AI that converts high-level goals into actionable checklists by reasoning step-by-step, using real-time tools, and streaming its internal thoughts to a responsive frontend.
* Built using **LangChain**, **React**, **Flask**, and powered by **Mistral** via **Ollama**.

## Tools
| Tool Name           | Purpose                                                             |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Current Date Tool   | Returns the current system date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format              |
| Current Time Tool   | Returns the current system time in `HH:MM:SS` format                |
| File Reader Tool    | Reads and returns the contents of `sample_data.txt` for context     |

---

## Agent Behavior
* Uses LangChain's MRKL Agent with memory and retry support
* Follows structured reasoning: Thought → Action → Observation → Final Answer
* Recovers gracefully from parser errors with handle_parsing_errors=True
* Capped loop retries via max_iterations=6 for speed and stability

---

## Features
* Local LLM integration via Mistral + Ollama
* Custom tools and streaming callbacks
* Responsive React frontend with line-by-line typing effect
* Frontend and backend fully decoupled
* Uses all tools during run (validated)
